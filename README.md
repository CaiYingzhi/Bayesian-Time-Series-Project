This repository contains my independent study project, where I price a Callable Barrier Reverse Convertible with a single underlying asset using various models.
A key highlight is the implementation of the Heston model with a Bayesian approach using Sequential Importance Resampling (SIR).
The performance of this approach is compared with other pricing models to evaluate accuracy and efficiency.
